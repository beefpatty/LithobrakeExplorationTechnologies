    - To enable, rename "GameData/LETech/Patches/LETech_RealChute.txt" to have "cfg" instead of "txt".
 - Removed references to "drogue" in the parachute tags.
 - Added parachute deployment sound effects, as per KSP 1.1.3.

0.3.5 (2016-04-22) - Transparency fix.
 - Fixed the "always transparent" problem for bays in the VAB.
 - Adjusted the "expanded" 2.5m bay to use transparency only on the doors.

0.3.4 (2016-04-17) - Tweaks.
 - Tweaked leg settings.
 - Moved leg wheel colliders to allow for more accurate aerodynamic occlusion.
 - Legs reduced in mass quite a bit.

0.3.3 (2016-04-01) - KSP 1.1 Hotfix
 - Landing leg suspension systems working again. Known issue: Feet float slightly.
 - Added search tags to parts.

0.3.2 (2016-03-29) - KSP 1.1 Hotfix
 - Landing legs updated to not be 100% deadly. Suspension still doesn't work, legs are rigid for now.
 - Moved MM configs to "Patches" folder.

0.3.1 (2016-01-11) - Tweaks.
 - X3 lander can mass increased.
 - Mass, fuel capacity, and cost increased for the "large" variant of the lander cargo bay.

0.3 (2015-11-11) - KSP 1.0.5 update.
 - Switched the 4-man capsule's "generic" IVA over to use the Mk3 shuttle's IVA instead, so that all 4 Kerbals are EVA/IVA selectable.
 - Moved "CHANGELOG" to the mod's directory.
 - Updated bays to use current cargo bay thermal stats and allow door deployment limit.
 - Parachutes now use new contract constraints.
 - Command pods use new maxTemp and skinMaxTemp values.
 - 4-man capsule uses new buoyancy settings.

0.2.1 (2015-08-05) - Alpha fixes.
 - Fixed a texture problem that resulted in the 1m and 2m fixed ladders not loading textures.
 - Fixed a scaling error with the "large" octagonal bay's doors, causing it to leave gaps when closed.
 - Radial parachute's storage case reduced in size by 15%.
 - Increased deployed-drag multiplier on all parachutes.
 - Added Connected Living Space support.
 - Added TweakScale support.

0.2 (2015-08-03) - Wide Alpha
 - Added 3 large parachutes: 1.25m & 2.5m stackable nose cones, and a large radial chute.
 - Added 4-man, 2.5m capsule-style command pod.
 - Added landing lights to the landing legs.
 - Fixed a collider issue with the Expanded 2.5m service bay that prevented use of the floor's attachment node.

 - First release.
