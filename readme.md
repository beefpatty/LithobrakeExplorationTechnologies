A parts pack that is focused on exploring other worlds, and returning safely to Kerbin. The emphasis is on surface exploration, particularly with large rockets and large landers. This pack includes:

 - 3-Man Lander Can
 - 4-Man Capsule
 - Several sets of large landing legs (the "medium" set will handle Mainsails, and the "large" works with Mammoths).
 - Large radial and stackable parachutes
 - Long static ladders
 - Very long deployable ladders
 - Service bays / rover garages.
